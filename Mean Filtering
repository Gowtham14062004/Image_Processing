% Load the original image

% Define the size of the filter (window size)
filterSize = 3; % Adjust this value based on the desired amount of blurring

% Get the dimensions of the original image
[rows, cols, ~] = size(originalImage);

% Initialize the filtered image matrix

% Apply the mean filter
for i = 1 + filterSize : rows - filterSize
for j = 1 + filterSize : cols - filterSize
% Extract the neighborhood of the current pixel

% Compute the mean value of the neighborhood

% Assign the mean value to the corresponding pixel in the filtered image
filteredImage_mean(i, j) = meanValue;
